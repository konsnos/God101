This is the first game Aristi Gi and me created after we had our children Ariadne and Callisto. Thankfully they let us jam for a couple of hours so we made it!

You are a little God, having your first test at school. They give you a little planet to take care of. Keep an eye on your planet and use your tools to repair everything that falls apart.

Have fun!
